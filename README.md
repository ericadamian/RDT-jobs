# Project: RDT-jobs

Website source code for http://rdt-jobs.com/

# Running locally

Website run on local server using XAMPP 7.2.34-0. In order to run code (MacOS), go to Applications>>xamppfiles>>htdocs>>and create a file (ie. folder called "website") where code will be stored.

In order to run servers, open XAMPP's manager-osx: under "manage servers", run MySQL Database, ProFTPD, and Apache Web Server. If MySQL Database does not start, enter on the command line: sudo killall mysqld (this will stop MySQL altogether) and restart.

Open code from file under localhost (typing "localhost" alone opens XAMPP main page, localhost/phpmyadmin opens phpMyAdmin database, and localhost/(**folder name**) will open coded files (ie. localhost/website)
